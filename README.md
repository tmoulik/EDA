# Description
I used R to explore Prosper Financial loan data.

This was a project done as part of the Udacity Course and it involved data visualization and analysis of a dataset of your own choice. I chose the Prosper financial loan data.

Some of the variables explored in this project are :

- Loan APR
- Credit Score
- Credit Grade
- Loan Status
- Delinquency,
- Trades Delinquent
- Home owner status
- Employment status.

The variables pertain to the actual loan, and variables which can affect the credit score of a person which in turn influences the APR of the loan.
