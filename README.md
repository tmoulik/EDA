## Description
In this project I used R to explore Prosper Financial loan data.

This project is done as part of the Udacity Course and it involves data visualization and analysis of a dataset, of one's 
own choice. I chose the Prosper financial loan data.

Some of the variables explored in this project are :

- Loan APR
- Credit Score
- Credit Grade
- Loan Status
- Delinquency,
- Trades Delinquent
- Home owner status
- Employment status.

Some of the variables characterize the loan while others affect the credit score, 
which in turn influences the APR of the loan. Some of these relationships are studied.
